## About The Project

This project provides a unique and customizable device ID hash generation method using PBKDF2 and SHA256 hashing algorithm. There are 2 modes to select:
1- FUll mode which uses both the hardware and software specs for device ID generation  
2- Semi mode which only uses hardware specs for device ID generation

Main Capabilities:

* Hardware-based and Software-based device ID generation modes
* PBKDF2 + SHA256 Hashing Algorithm
* Static Salting (settable)
* Customizable Hashing Key size + Hashing Iteration Times.
* Hashing process time tracking.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo in visual studio
```sh
https://github.com/idpNET/unique_deviceID.git
```
2. Run the app and Get Started!

## Usage

Running the console app, you get prompted to select the device ID generation mode (FULL: using both the hardware and software specs - Semi: using the hardware specs only). Hitting enter button, you get final results including the unique device ID hash value, and the process time.

P.S This project is well commented ! You can refer to the inline code comments for more information
